Doing this will log you out of your Muse Dash account and you will have to log in again once you do this, but it will help you to be able to play.

1) Close Muse Dash.
2) Hold `[Win + R]`, enter `regedit` and click **OK** to start the Registry Editor.
3) Navigate between the folders in this order: **`HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> SOFTWARE -> PeroPeroGames -> MuseDash`**.
4) Search among the variables for one with the name **[`GameConfig_h`]**.
5) Right click on the variable, **delete it** and launch the game again.
